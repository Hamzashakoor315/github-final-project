# Simple Interest Calculator

A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

## Input
- **p**: Principal amount  
- **t**: Time period in years  
- **r**: Annual rate of interest  

## Output
- **Simple Interest** = (p * t * r) / 100

## Example
If p = 1000, t = 2 years, r = 5%,  
then Simple Interest = (1000 * 2 * 5) / 100 = 100.

## Technologies Used
- Python (or whichever language youâ€™re using)
- Git and GitHub for version control
